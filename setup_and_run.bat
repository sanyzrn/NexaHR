title NexaHR - Setup and Run

REM ============================================================
REM  NexaHR - local development bootstrap (Windows)
REM
REM  *** DEVELOPMENT ONLY - DO NOT RUN ON A REAL DEPLOYMENT ***
REM
REM  This script deliberately writes ENVIRONMENT=development, a
REM  fixed JWT_SECRET_KEY, SEED_DEMO_DATA=true (sample accounts
REM  whose shared password is published in the repository) and
REM  MIN_COHORT_SIZE=1, which turns OFF the suppression that
REM  keeps a three-person "unit average" from being read back as
REM  those three people's scores.
REM
REM  For a real deployment see deploy/PRODUCTION.md - it ships
REM  built container images and never puts any of the above on
REM  the server.
REM
REM  TWO DESIGN RULES FOR THIS SCRIPT:
REM
REM  1. Never open the browser on a broken stack. A dead backend
REM     still serves a perfectly healthy-looking login page that
REM     simply cannot log anyone in, and that is the single most
REM     confusing way for this to fail.
REM
REM  2. Never end on an instruction the user cannot follow. The
REM     old version stopped with "run psql -U postgres ..." - but
REM     the PostgreSQL installer does not put psql on PATH, so
REM     that command failed too and the setup dead-ended. Where
REM     this script can fix something itself, it does; where it
REM     genuinely cannot, it says exactly what to do.
REM
REM  Checks verify that a thing WORKS, not that it EXISTS. "python
REM  is on PATH" is not the same as "python runs and is new
REM  enough" - on a fresh Windows 11, `python` is usually a Store
REM  stub that satisfies the first and fails the second.
REM ============================================================

set "ROOT=%~dp0"
set "ROOT=%ROOT:~0,-1%"
set "BACKEND=%ROOT%\backend"
set "FRONTEND=%ROOT%\frontend"
set "VENV=%BACKEND%\.venv"

REM Minimum versions, kept next to each other so they are easy to
REM find when a dependency raises the bar.
REM   Python 3.11 - app code imports `datetime.UTC`, added in 3.11.
REM   Node 20.19  - required by Vite 8 (see frontend/package.json).
set "MIN_PY_MAJOR=3"
set "MIN_PY_MINOR=11"

REM UTF-8 mode, set once and inherited by both server windows.
REM
REM Without this, `import app.main` dies before binding a port:
REM slowapi builds its Limiter by reading backend\.env through
REM starlette's Config, which uses the OS default encoding. On a
REM Persian Windows install that is cp1252, and a single Persian
REM comment in .env raises UnicodeDecodeError. The generated .env
REM is kept ASCII as well (step 4) so a manually started uvicorn
REM works too - but this line means it works either way.
set "PYTHONUTF8=1"
set "PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8"

REM Sample users/personnel are seeded on purpose here: this script
REM bootstraps a LOCAL DEVELOPMENT environment. The flag is read by
REM the backend at startup and is never set in production.

REM --- Python: must actually run, and be new enough ---------------
REM `where python` is deliberately NOT used. On a fresh Windows 11
REM it finds %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe - an
REM App Execution Alias that opens the Microsoft Store and prints
REM nothing. It satisfies `where`, creates no venv, and the first
REM real symptom is a confusing failure several steps later.
REM Running it and reading the version back is the only check that
REM distinguishes a real interpreter from the stub.
REM Detection lives in a subroutine because the probe command contains
REM parentheses - `print(...)`. Inside a parenthesised if/for block, cmd
REM matches the first `)` it sees against the block instead of the
REM command, and the line silently does the wrong thing. At subroutine
REM top level there is no enclosing block to confuse it.

REM  caller and let the script carry on past a fatal error.
